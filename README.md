# Modern Developer: Mastering CSS Projects
This repo contains the projects for Modern Developer Mastering Web Development course. All Projects are done with Pure-CSS functionality.

##Tab Component
[live tab](https://jjs88.github.io/MD-mastering-css-projects/tabs-component)

This project uses radio buttons as the foundation for the tabs. The radio buttons remain hidden and the labels act as the tabs. When a user clicks on a label, the CSS selector ":checked" will be triggered which will un-hide the content for the specific label along with some animations to accompany the change.

##Accordion Component
[live accordion](https://jjs88.github.io/MD-mastering-css-projects/accordion-component)

This project uses radio buttons/labels as the basis for the accordian look. Similar to the tab component, when the user clicks a label, the :checked selector will be triggered which will then display the content using smooth animation.

##Business Card Component
[live business card](https://jjs88.github.io/MD-mastering-css-projects/business-card-component)

This project uses pure CSS3 to create a flip card.
